# G20_Project
- Assignment project for GS20 Internship Submission.

# How to run?
- As this is a NodeJS project , So you have to download Node first , you can download it using any browser. Just go and search For Node Js and download the latest version.

- Now after downloading Node, download node modules using command ```npm install``` and then set up .env in the root folder 
and enter the following content in the env file
```
MONGO_URI = ""
PORT = 5100
HOST = ""
```
change the above content according to your configuration.

- Now for running the application use the following command ```npm start``` or ```node app.js```.

- I have hosted it on AWS Machine using Apache, as this method is completely free.
